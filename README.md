sharelatex-full
==============

A [sharelatex](https://hub.docker.com/r/sharelatex/sharelatex) docker image with TeX Live's full installation scheme installed (that is, most of the TeX packages you'd ever need)

## Versions

Tags of this image on Docker Hub are precicely the same as the `sharelatex/sharelatex` tag that the image is based on.

## Usage

Overleaf's [Quick start guide](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) contains a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file that acts as a great start to use the sharelatex image. 
Simply replace the sharelatex image with this one to get the full version.
